# ShelfSage

## Overview

ShelfSage is a personalized book recommendation web app that allows users to discover books based on their reading preferences or what they have on their 'shelf'. The user will be able to create a profile, add books to their 'shelf', and receive book recommendations similar to Netflix. I will be using AI to recommend books based on the user's interactions and saved books.

### Problem Space

There is an overwhelming amount of books in the world and finding one that matches an individual's tastes can be difficult. Readers rely on reviews online or browsing bookstores; or often invest money and time in books that are not satisfying. My web app simplifies this by offering personalized recommendations, eliminating the need for excess research on their next read.

### User Profile

ShelfSage is designed for avid readers who want to keep track of their growing piles of books. Users will be able to:
 - Search for books, authors, genres
 - Add books to their personal shelf
 - Remove books from their personal shelf
 - Receive personal book recommendations
 - View details about books
 - Manage their profile and account settings

### Features
Book detail modal: Clicking on a book opens a modal that includes a synopsis, genre, and option to add/remove the book from the user's shelf. This is implemented throughout the web app.
1. Homepage:
 - Search functionality: A search bar at the top of the page will allow the user to find books based on title, author, or genre from the Goodreads API.
 - Popular book section: List of popular books displayed with a horizontal scroll.
2. User's Shelf Page:
 - Bookshelf view: Users can see the books they've saved, displayed as cards.
3. Recommendation page: 
 - Recommendations on a horizontal scroll, separated into lists based on genre, authors, and keywords.
4. Profile Page:
 - Basic user management
 - Changing username and password
 - User can upload/change profile image
 - A delete profile button

## Implementation

## Future Implementations
The primary goal for this web app is to ensure that the core functionality is operational and that the application is polished enough for deployment. However, if time constraints arise, prioritizing a working local version of the website is preferable to a broken deployed version. As such, deployment may be considered a post-project task.

Additionally, the initial recommendation engine will focus on using Metadata and user interactions to suggest books. In the future, I plan to integrate a user similarity-based recommendation system. This enhancement will require a larger user base and additional time to develop and refine the recommendation algorithms.
